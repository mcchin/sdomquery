# Small DOM Query

Just want a small library to query DOM for micro projects instead of including the entire jQuery.

Inspired by the following links:

1. http://www.sitepoint.com/jquery-vs-raw-javascript-1-dom-forms/
2. https://github.com/szarouski/lodash.dom-traverse/
3. https://github.com/ctult/TinyDOM
4. http://jquery.com/
