# Simple DOM Query

Just want a small enough library to query DOM for micro projects instead of including the entire jQuery.

1. Imitating jQuery function, so that is easier for people who already familiar with jQuery.
2. Only have necessary core functions to access DOM (Traverse, query, apply CSS, DOM positioninig, and probably some DOM manipulation and events handling)
3. It won't be a direct drop-in for jQuery (e.g. Zepto)

Inspired by the following links:

1. http://www.sitepoint.com/jquery-vs-raw-javascript-1-dom-forms/
2. https://github.com/szarouski/lodash.dom-traverse/

4. http://jquery.com/
